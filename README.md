# ARENA: An Approach for the Automated Generation of Release Notes

## Exploratory Study on Existing Release Notes
In this study, we manually analyzed 990 release notes from 55 software projects and classify their content. Specifically, the analyzed release notes belong to:

* 608 releases of 41 open-source projects from the Apache ecosystem (e.g., Ant, log4j, etc.),
* 382 releases of 14 open-source projects developed by other open-source communities (e.g., jEdit, Selenium, etc.), and

| **Exploratory study results.** Spreadsheet file reporting the system, release identifier, and content classification of 990 release notes.  | [XLSX] |

## ARENA's Design
In order to generate the textual content of a release note, ARENA defines a set of templates according to the kind of artifact and kind of change to be described.

## Empirical Study I: On the Completeness of ARENA Release Notes
This empirical study aims at evaluating the completeness of the release notes generated by ARENA. The context of this study consists of:

* *Objects*: automatically generated and original release notes of eight releases of five open-source projects.
* *Subjects*: ten evaluators corresponding to one B.Sc. student, five M.Sc. students, one Ph.D. student, one faculty and two industrial developers.

| **Pre-study questionnaire.** Spreadsheet files containing the pre-study questionnaire, as given to each participant of the study. | [XLSX] |
| **Original release notes.** Spreadsheet files containing the itemized content of the original release notes of the considered software projects, as given to the participants of the study. Each file contains also an assessment table for participants to evaluate the content of the original release note when compared to the generated one. | [ZIP] |
| **ARENA release notes.** HMTL files containing the release notes generated by ARENA for the considered software projects, as given to the participants of the study. | [ZIP] |
| **Study responses.** Spreadsheets corresponding to the evaluations provided by the participants for the release notes of each considered system. For each release note, two evaluations were obtained. | [ZIP] |

## Empirical Study II: On the Importance of ARENA Release Notes
The goal of this empirical study is to evaluate the importance of the captured and missed items in the ARENA release notes. The context of this study consists of:

* *Objects*: automatically generated and original release notes of two releases of two open-source projects.
* *Subject*s: 38 professional and open-source developers.

| **Study responses.** CSV file containing the responses provided by the participants to the questionnaire. For completeness, we provide a legend file containing a mapping between the naming conventions used in the responses file and the questionnaire. | [CSV] |
| **R script for plot generation.** R script for generating the plots that appear in the paper based on the responses file (provided above). | [R] |

## Empirical Study III: Post-mortem Evaluation with Developers
The goal of this empirical study is to evaluate the generated release note on its own, and to compare it with the one produced manually by the team leader. The context of this study consists of:

* *Object*s: automatically and manually generated release notes of the SMOS system.
* *Subjects*: five original developers of the SMOS system.

| **Study responses.** ZIP file containing the responses provided by the participants to the questionnaire. | [ZIP] |

## Empirical Study IV: Long-term In-field Evaluation
The goal of this empirical study is to evaluate the quality and usefulness of the release notes generated by ARENA in a rela, everyday working environment. The context of this study consists of:

* *Objects*: automatically generated release notes of the OM system.
* *Subjects*: development team of the OM system.
